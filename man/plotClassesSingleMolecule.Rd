\usage{
plotClassesSingleMolecule(
  dataOrderedByClass,
  xRange = c(-250, 250),
  title = "Reads by classes",
  myXlab = "CpG/GpC position",
  featureLabel = "TSS",
  baseFontSize = 12,
  segmentSize = 5,
  colourChoice = list(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", bg = "white", lines =
    "black"),
  colourScaleMidpoint = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataOrderedByClass}{A matrix of methylation or bincount values (reads x position) that have been ordered by class. The assigned class, e.g. "__class1" etc has been appended to read names.}

\item{xRange}{A vector of the first and last coordinates of the region to plot (default is c(-250,250))}

\item{title}{A title for the plot (default is "Reads by classes")}

\item{myXlab}{A label for the x axis (default is "CpG/GpC position")}

\item{featureLabel}{A label for a feature you want to plot, such as the position of the TSS (default="TSS")}

\item{baseFontSize}{The base font for the plotting theme (default=12 works well for 4x plots per A4 page)}

\item{segmentSize}{Length of colour segment denoting methylation site}

\item{colourChoice}{A list of colours for colour pallette. Must include
values for "low", "mid", "high" and "bg" (background) and "lines".}

\item{colourScaleMidpoint}{Numerical value for middle of colour scale. Useful for Nanopore data where a particular threshold other than 0.5 is used to distinguish methylated from non-methylated sites. (default=0.5).}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot2 object of a single molecule plot sorted by classes
}
\description{
Create a single molecule plot of the reads sorted by class.
